# Normalisation Challenge

**Challenge A:** Extend your people table to include information about credit cards, including card type, card number, expiry date, and CVV number (the 3 digits on the back).

**Challenge B:** Create a set of tables to solve the problem of a person having more than one credit card. Ensuring you normalise the data correctly to remove redundancy.

**Challenge C:** If a person also has multiple jobs, how could you record that in tables?
