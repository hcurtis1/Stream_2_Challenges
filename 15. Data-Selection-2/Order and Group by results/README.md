# Order By andGroup By Challenge

**Challenge A:**
Using the example query:

	``` SQL
	SELECT * FROM my_db.orders
	WHERE created_at
	BETWEEN
	'2015-09-08 14:48:00'
	AND
	'2016-09-08 15:34:00'
	AND NOT
	amount > 12.00;
	```

Add in descending ordering on the amount column.

**Challenge B:**
If you donâ€™t have more than one person in your people table, add one more and then add a few more orders for them into the orders table.

Next, run the previous query WITHOUT the GROUP BY clause and see what you get from your own unique results.
