# Exceptions Challenge for File IO

* Write a program which allows the user to enter their own quiz questions, which are appended to the questions file. You will have to open the file using mode ‘w’ and use f.write or f.writelines.

* Change the program so that the user has several guesses per question.

* Detect if the answer is right but the spelling is wrong. For instance, if only 2 characters are different, allow this as a correct answer.
