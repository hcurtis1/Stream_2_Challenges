# Challenge below is for Refactoring in Pycharm

* Change **RANGE** and **NUMBER_OF_GUESSES** to something else.
* It would be better if the user knew what range the number is within. Modify the program at **line 21** (where we print “let’s try a new number!”) so that it tells the user what the range is, by using the **RANGE** variable.
* We could also tell the user how many guesses they’ve got left. Modify the program again to first work out how many guesses are left, then tell the user.
* Change the program so that the range can be anything, i.e. it doesn’t always start at 0.
* Notice what happens when you type in a word, not a number. We will explore this further when we get to File IO and Exceptions, where you will learn how to handle errors like this in a more elegant manner.
