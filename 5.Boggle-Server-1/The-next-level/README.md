# Challenge for the Boggle Solver

* Change the program so that it works with a 2×2 grid, and then again with a 3×3 grid. Use a stopwatch to get an approximate idea of the difference in time taken to run. Now, estimate (or just take a wild guess) how long you think a 4×4 grid would take. In the next module, we’ll see if you’re right.
* Go back and read the tests again in order, and try to recall how you made each one pass, then look at the code and see how much of the program you actually remember. Use a notebook to write down the parts you had forgotten.
* Refactor the main function to extract the code for displaying the words and put it in a method called display_words.
