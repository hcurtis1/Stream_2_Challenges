# Code Coverage

* Write some more tests and see if you can cover the entirety of the function.
* Make the vending machine evil by not returning change when the item isnâ€™t available, or returning slightly less change than it should.
* Extend the program so that it takes a list of coins, not an amount.
* Extend the program to deal with a machine that has run out of certain coins, for instance 20p.
